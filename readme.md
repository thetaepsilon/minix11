# minix11

Dotfiles I use for a minimal x11 setup using bspwm, sxhkd and dmenu.

Files under dotfiles/ should be placed in your home;
note that the xinitrc is titled "session.xinitrc"
as on my system it is called by a primary .xinitrc which invokes dbus-run-session.

Scripts under bin/ are optional but should be placed in your $PATH if desired.
Please refer to the comments in these scripts for any needed configuration.
